If you're on a Windows device, simply download the file called 'Download This Zip File Third', extract and open it and navigate to the windows section.
Then double click the .exe file within and thats it, the game should fire up in your command line.




If you're on a Mac, we have to bypass the fact that MacOS doesn't like you running an executable file that isn't from an identified developer.

(You only have to do this once each time you download the game)

Download the 'Download This Zip File Third.zip' file
Depending on what Mac you have, either open the Intel game or the Apple Silicon game. (2021 onwards is Apple Silicon)
Double click the file that has a black icon

It will scream at you, telling you "you're not allowed to do this"
Click "OK"

Open settings
Go to security & privacy
Scroll down a bit

Just below where it says 'allow apps from identified developers only', it should say "GoldDiggerzz was restricted from opening"
Click "Open Anyway"
Wait a second, the game should load up for you.

From next time you want to play, simply double click the black icon file and then it should just run with no error from there onwards
