             * This is my digging simulator guys
             * initial ideas:
             * (initial inspiration: https://replit.com/@AadityaKalwani/Digging-Simulator#main.py)
             * basically you dig and you get x amount of gold per day with a possibility of getting diamonds too
             * you can use gold to go to the market and upgrade stuff like your shovel and employees
             * it follows the gregorian calendar
             * so for example, on weekends the employees want extra pay and once per few months the stock market crashes and your gold rates plummet
             * you can trade gold and diamonds for $$$ depending on the rates
             * you use your $$$ to buy upgrades for things like your shovel or your employees
             * or you can 'restart' and sacrifice all your $$$ for a better location with better gold payments per day
             * (like prestige in all the idle miner games i played)
